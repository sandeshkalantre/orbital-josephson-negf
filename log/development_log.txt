This is a log file to store my notes on the development of the code for this project. It consists of entries when changes were made to the codebase and when certain results were achieved.

Intial commit. Reproducing Josephson results (current-phase) for N-channel with superconducting contacts. Adding a magnetic field to see the effects. Using a spin-orbit and Zeeman nanowire in 4x1 Nambu space.  
I defined the Hamiltonian creation routines. The next step is to look at the spectrum. There were non-trivial issues when defining the spin orbit term for a cylindrical nanowire. Right now I used the form that is used (sigma_y p_z) that is used for 1D nanowires. The next step is to just look at the spectum for a long enough nanowire.

I wrote the dos code for cylidrical nanowire with flux. I need to spend time thinking about the discretisation and the convergence for B-fields.
Surface dos test complete. I want to see a 2D plot of how the surface_dos looks like in mu-Delta space.

I wrote the current-phase code for one-dim nanowire and observed the critical current as a function of mu. It goes to zero as the bands are depopulated.

The next step is to repeat the same calculation for a wire with a finite cross-section without a magnetic field.
Then introduce a magnetic field to see interference.

Oscillations observed in small lattice sizes. I am writing the separate l-subband model.

I am doing a time-profiling of the code to find the RDS.
calc_hamiltonian 
- for small Hamiltonian (N_z,N_phi) = (2,5)  : 2 ms
- for large Hamiltonian (N_z,N_phi) = (25,10): 550 ms
- for verr large Hamiltonians (N_z,N_phi) = (100,15) : 17240 ms

I will now fix to a (N_z,N_phi) = (2,5) value.
calc_surface_g : E_vec = (-2e-3,2e-3,100) :  1100 ms
87% of time spent in calculating the inverse for the next step in the iteration

calc_sns_negf : E_vec = (-2e-3,2e-3,100) : 1950 ms 
97.8% of time spent in calc_surface_g for left lead and right lead (close to 50 % for each)
The left and right lead Hamiltonians have different Delta, so reuse is not possible

dos-phi calculation : 100 phi points : 200 s
This scaled perfectly from the single phi calculation

I-phi calculation : 100 phi points : 193 s
100 % of time in calc_sns_negf; scales as expected


I-flux calculation : 100 flux points : 2.5 hrs (from on old simulation)
This scaled properly from the single I-phi calculation. 

No speedup is possible except at calc_sns_negf level or via parallelization
